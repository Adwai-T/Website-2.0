<h1 id="h1-0">SalesForce Admin</h1>
<h2 id="h2-0">PickLists</h2>
<quote> A noraml picklist set can be promoted to a global picklist by using <strong>Promote to Global Value Set</strong> button on the picklist.</quote>
<h3 id="h3-0">Global Picklists</h3>
<p>Global value sets let you share the same picklist values with more than one picklist field.</p>

<p>Global value sets are always restricted and cannot be converted into unrestricted, this protects the values as changing global value set changes it for all the fields that use it.</p>

<quote> Quick search option <samp>Picklist Value Sets</samp>.</quote>
<p>We can add new value, reorder, replace, and change the default value of a global value set. We can also edit, delete, and deactivate individual values.</p>

<p>When custom picklist use a global picklist set, a single select can be changed to multi select, but it cannot be changed to any different datatype.</p>

<p>Custom picklist field's association with a global value set cannot be undone.</p>

<h3 id="h3-1">Dependent Picklist</h3>
<p>When there are two picklist or a picklist and a checkbox field, a dependency can be created between them by clicking the <strong>Field Dependencies</strong> button on the top right of the <strong>Fields and Relationship</strong> page an object.</p>

<p>Then select Controlling Field and Dependent Field. Next choose the options from dependent picklist values to be included when a value from the controlling picklist is selected and click Include Values, then save.</p>

<quote> A controlling picklist can at most have 300 values.</quote>
<h3 id="h3-2">Picklist Limits</h3>
<p>For standard picklist the value can be 255 character long, which count the line break and return character.</p>

<p>Restricted picklist can have upto 1000 values that includes active as well as inactive.</p>

<p>Unrestricted picklist can have upto 1000 values and upto 4000 inactive values.</p>

<p>In custom multiselect picklist a user can have upto 500 values, each with upto 255 characters and can select upto 100 values at a time on a record.</p>

<p>Global picklist set can have a combination of 1000 active and inactive values.</p>

<p>Upto 500 Global picklist set can be created in an org, and any number of picklists can use these sets.</p>

<p>If a global picklist value set is applied to more than 13 different object, the values can be deactivated but not replaced or deleted.</p>

<p>Controlling picklist can have atmost 300 values.</p>

<h2 id="h2-1">Relationships</h2>
<h3 id="h3-3">Relationship between Account and Opportunity</h3>
<p>Relationship between Account and opportunity is a standard relationship even if shows as a lookup relation ship in schema builder.</p>

<p>This is a kind of default relationship between the two objects such that we can create a rollup summary on the account object for opportunity.</p>

<p>Also when the account is deleted, the opportunity related to the account are deleted.</p>

<h3 id="h3-4">Many To Many Relationship</h3>
<p>Salesforce does not provide a direct option to create a many to many realtionship.</p>

<p>However a many to many relationship can be created by using two <strong>Master Detail Relationship</strong> on a <strong>Juntion object</strong> that has the two object that need to be linked with many to many relationship as the Master.</p>

<p>The First Master Details relationship created on the Junction object becomes the <strong>Primary relationship</strong> and effect the records of the junction object in following ways -</p>

<ul>
	<li> <strong>Look and feel</strong> of edit page, icons and color of primary relationship are used.</li>
	<li> <strong>Record ownership</strong> is inherited from the Owner field value of the primary Master, even if there is no Owner field on details object record.</li>
	<li> <strong>Division</strong> - if used is inherit their division from primary master record.</li>
</ul>
<p>For <strong>Related List</strong> Label use an appropriate name that represent the relationship between the two objects.</p>

<p>If the primary master-detail relationship is deleted or converted to lookup, the secondary master detail relationship becomes primary.</p>

<h4 id="h4-0">Customize the Related List</h4>
<p>To create a seemless experience for user, the related list where the relationship is displayed can be customized.</p>

<p>Edit the page layout for each of the Object linked by the Many to Many relationship. In the related list click on the wrench icon and add the field that refers to the other object.</p>

<p>This will make it convenient for the user to see the related object directly in the related list.</p>

<h2 id="h2-2">Process Automation</h2>
<h3 id="h3-5">Salesforce Flow</h3>
<p>Salesforce Flow provides declarative process automation.</p>

<ul>
	<li> SalesForce Flow -> Product</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li> Flow Builder and Process Builder -> Tools</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other automation tools that can be used such as workflow rules and process builder that are used but are going to be retired and hence it is important to use Salesforce flow.</p>

<ul>
	<li> Use Cases for Salesforce Flow :</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li> Set up automated tasks and processes.</li>
	<li> Create a guided tutorial or wizard with screens.</li>
	<li> Connect to external systems.</li>
	<li> Add automation to your pages and apps.</li>
	<li> Reuse what you build.</li>
</ol>
<quote> It is always best to start with declarative non code tools first and work our way up to code solutions as they are much easier to manage.</quote>
<ul>
	<li> Cases and what automation tool to use :</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li> Guided visual experience : processes that need input from users -> Flow Builder</li>
	<li> Behind-the-scenes automation : user input isnâ€™t needed. and salesforce has all the data that is needed -> Flow builder or process builder (if existing) or Apex</li>
	<li> Approval automation : Business processes that determine how a record, like a time-off request, gets approved by the right stakeholders. -> Approvals</li>
</ol>
<ul>
	<li> Use of Flow Builder :</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li> Automate a guided visual experience.</li>
	<li> Start a behind-the-scenes business process: such as create, update, delete a record or when platform event occur or even at a specified time or frequency.</li>
</ol>
<p>Use of Process builder :</p>

<p>It is now not recommended to use process builder and instead use flow builder as they have the same functionality and flow builder is the current tool and will be updated to get better.</p>

<ul>
	<li> Use Apex With flow :</li>
</ul>
<p>Use Apex when you need more functionality than is available in Flow Builder. Build the more complex functionality as invocable Apex methods. Then call the resulting Apex as an Apex action in the process or as an Apex action element in the flow.</p>

<h3 id="h3-6">Process Builder</h3>
<quote> <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.process_overview.htm&type=5" target="_blank">Official Docs Process Builder</a>.</quote>
<p>Automate if/then business processes and see a graphical representation of your process as you build.</p>

<quote> Use <strong>Process Builder</strong> in Quick Find.</quote>
<p>Component of Process :</p>

<ul>
	<li> Trigger : Identify When the Process Should Run.</li>
</ul><p>  1. Only when record is created.  2. Anytime a record is created and edited.</p>
<ul>
	<li> Criteria : Determine Whether or Not to Execute Actions.</li>
</ul><p>  1. Set filter conditions.  2. Enter a custom formula. Like in validation rules, the formula must resolve to true or false.</p>
<p>  3. Opt out of criteria and always execute the associated actions.</p>
<ul>
	<li> Actions : What the Process Should Do.</li>
</ul><p>  1. Immediate Action.  2. Scheduled Action.</p>
<ul>
	<li> Actions that can be performed</li>
</ul><p>  1. Create records.  2. Update the record that started the process or any related record.</p>
<p>  3. Submit that record for approval.</p>
<p>  4. Update one or more related records.</p>
<p>  5. Send emails using a specified email template.</p>
<p>  6. Post to a Chatter feed.</p>

<h4 id="h4-1">Process Types</h4>
<ol>
	<li> Record Change : A record is created or edited</li>
	<li> Invocable : Itâ€™s called by another process</li>
	<li> Platform Event : A platform event message is received</li>

<h3 id="h3-9">Event Monitoring</h3>
<quote> Shield Event monitoring is a only free in developer org, but needs to be purchased for all other org types.</quote>
<ul>
	<li> <strong>Developer Edition</strong> organizations have free access to all log types with 1-day data retention.</li>
	<li> <strong>Enterprise</strong>, Unlimited, and Performance Edition organizations have free access to the insecure external assets, login, logout, and total API usage event log files with 1-day data retention. For an extra cost, you can access all log file types with 30-day data retention.</li>
</ul>
<p>Event monitoring provides tracking for many types of events such as :</p>

<ul>
	<li> Logins</li>
	<li> Logouts</li>
	<li> URI (web clicks in Salesforce Classic)</li>
	<li> Lightning (web clicks, performance, and errors in Lightning Experience and the Salesforce mobile app)</li>
	<li> Visualforce page loads</li>
	<li> Application programming interface (API) calls</li>
	<li> Apex executions</li>
	<li> Report exports</li>
</ul>
<quote> There are 50 such event that can be monitored.</quote>
<p>Event Monitoring can be used for which of the following scenarios?</p>
<p>-> Monitoring which IP addresses users are logging in form.</p>

<p>Youâ€™re developing a new application for your organization. According to Salesforce best practices, what should you consider first?</p>
<p>-> API-first approach to development.</p>

<h2 id="h2-3">Prepare Your Salesforce Org for Users</h2>
<h3 id="h3-10">Set Up the Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>Multi Currency for the organization can be set up through <samp>Company Information</samp> in the setup.</p>

<p>First Enable the <samp>Activate Multiple Currencies</samp>. After saving an additional button to setup the currency named <samp>Currency Setup</samp> will be available at the top of the Company Information page.</p>

<p>On the Currency Setup page, new currencies can be added and a static exchange rate for the currency can be set up.</p>

<h3 id="h3-11">Currency Mamangement Tool</h3>
<p>When there are multiple currencies setup in the organization, the exchange rates need to be managed as salesforce does not automaitcally update the rates.</p>

<p>These rates can be set up either to be static where they are changed as needed or can be setup so that they change according to the date setup.</p>

<h2 id="h2-4">Deliverability</h2>
<p>In Setup Quick find.</p>

<p>Access to send emails if they can be send.</p>

<p>Test Deliverability : Test email being send.</p>

<h2 id="h2-5">Data Security</h2>
<quote> Even id security is configured completely throught the user interface, it will still be enforced even when the user uses API calls to query or update data.</quote>
<h3 id="h3-12">Users</h3>
<p>Users use Salesforce <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.users_licenses_overview.htm&type=5" target="_blank">licenses</a>. Each user has exactly one license and one profile.</p>

<quote> Available <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.users_licenses_overview.htm&type=5" target="_blank">Licenses</a> for the organization can be viewed in <strong>Company Information</strong>.</quote>
<p>Every Salesforce user is identified by a username, a password, and a single profile.</p>

<p>Together with other settings, the profile determines what tasks users can perform, what data they see, and what they can do with the data.</p>

<h3 id="h3-13">Profiles</h3>
<quote> Salesforce has an enhanced profile user interface that makes it easy to find and modify profile settings. User Management Settings | (Enable) <strong>Enhanced Profile User Interface</strong>.</quote>
<p>If a user already is given access to some data in the profile that permission cannot be taken away by any other security setting like permission set, so the profile should be the most restrictive and access should be opened up using permission set and sharing settings.</p>

<ul>
	<li> Profiles control the access to object and fields.</li>
	<li> They also control access to Tabs and Apps.</li>
	<li> Login Hours can also be set for particular profiles.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="h4-2">Standard Profiles</h4>
<p>They can be views as templates that can be cloned to create custom profiles that are used. They can be assigned directly to a user but have limitations over custom profiles that are created by cloning them.</p>

<p>Standard profiles permission cannot be edited but some settings can be customized, such as</p>

<ul>
	<li> Custom App Settings</li>
	<li> Tab Settings</li>
	<li> Desktop Integration Client Options</li>
	<li> Session Settings</li>
	<li> Password Policies</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="h4-3">Custom Profiles</h4>
<p>Custom Profiles are created by using standard profiles as template and they are mostly assigned to users. A Custom profile cannot be created from scratch, a standard profile that is the closest to the functionality need to be used and cloned.</p>

<p>Unlike Standard Profiles all the settings in Custom Profiles can be modified.</p>

<h3 id="h3-14">Permission Set</h3>
<p>The interface for configuring permission sets look very similar to that of the profile as they have the same type of permissions that can be granted.</p>

<p>Permission sets details page <samp>Manage Assignments</samp> (button) can be used to see all users assgined the permission set and add that permission set to new users.</p>

<p>Also on User Details page the permission sets assigned to the user can be viewed and new permission sets can be assigned.</p>

<h3 id="h3-15">Permission Set Group</h3>
<p>Group a number of permission sets that might to be given to simialr type of users.</p>

<p>In this a newer feature of permission set group is mute permissions sets in group in which some permissions sets can be muted and reactivated/unmuted as needed.</p>

<p>We can also see under combined permission, all the permissions together that are granted by all the permission sets in the permission set group.</p>

<h3 id="h3-16">Organization</h3>
<p>For the whole org, you can maintain a list of authorized users, set password policies, and limit logins to certain hours and locations.</p>

<h4 id="h4-4">Set Password Policy</h4>
<p>Goto <strong>Setup | Security | Password Policy</strong></p>

<p>Set the password restrictions and login lockout policies for all users.</p>

<h4 id="h4-5">Network Access</h4>
<p>Goto <strong>Setup | Security | Network Access</strong></p>

<p>Allow for giving access to certain Ip-Addresses througn which logging-in would not need access code.</p>

<p>They are called as Trusted IP Address Ranges.</p>

<quote> From Profile Login Ip Ranges can be set, they are not the same as Trusted IP Address Ranges.</quote>
<ul>
	<li> Login Ip Address Ranges : Settings that control the IP addresses from which users can log in.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li> Trusted Ip Address Ranges : Contains IP address ranges from sources that your organization trusts. Users logging in to salesforce.com with a browser from trusted networks are allowed to access salesforce.com without having to activate their computers.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="h4-6">Session Settings</h4>
<p>Contol session connection types, timeout restrictions, Ip Address ranges etc.</p>

<p>It also controls what sessions security levels such as multifactor authentication being considered High assurance and other like username and password, lightning login etc as standard authentication.</p>

<p>It also controls the pages users are redirected to when they logout. This could be to some custom Url or by default is to salesforce login page.</p>

<h4 id="h4-7">Admin Can Login As Any User</h4>
<p>For testing adming might want to login in as a different user.</p>

<p>To Enable this as a org policy goto <strong>Setup | Security | Login Access Policies</strong> and enable <strong>Administrators can login in as Any User</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="h3-17">Objects</h3>
<p>By setting permissions on a particular type of object, you can prevent a group of users from creating, viewing, editing, or deleting any records of that object.</p>

<quote> Record detail pages can be reached by placing a record ID at the root of the URL.</quote>
<p>You can set object permissions with profiles or permission sets. Permission sets grant additional permissions and access settings to a user.</p>

<p>Users are assigend one profile and can be assigned any number of permission sets.</p>

<p>Permissions can also allow user to create or edit records of a given type, run reports, and customize the app.</p>

<quote> The <samp>View All Data</samp> and <samp>Modify All Data</samp> overrides all other sharing settings, role hierarcy, and sharing rules, so should only be assigned to system administrator.</quote>
<h3 id="h3-18">Fields</h3>
<p>You can restrict access to certain fields, even if a user has access to the object.</p>

<p>Like objects field access can be controlled by the profile and by using permission sets.</p>

<p>Field Access are given just below object settings, and have two options (Read Access, Edit Access).</p>

<p>In field details page in object manager, <strong>View Fields Accessibility</strong> (button top center) shows the accessibility for different profiles. <strong>Where it is used</strong> is another button next ot view fields accessibility that shows where the field is referenced (eg page layouts). Where it is used is not availabe for standard fields.</p>

<quote> There is a 900 maximum hard limit on total custom fields per object.</quote>
<h3 id="h3-19">Records</h3>
<p>You can allow particular users to view an object, but then restrict the individual object records they're allowed to see.</p>

<p>Controlled inside <strong>Sharing Settings</strong>.</p>

<quote> Organization Wide Default is the most restrictive, as you go down the list the options can be used to open up the organization security for more users selectively.</quote>
<h4 id="h4-8">Organization Wide Default</h4>
<p>Specify the default level of access users have to each otherâ€™s records.</p>

<quote> In Organization Wide Default all standard objects have <strong>Grant Access Using Hierarchies</strong> enabled by default and it cannot be changed while it can be disabled for custom objects.</quote>

<p>When MFA is turned on, users need to provide multifactor every time they log in.</p>

<p>Orgs can be setup to require MFA for additional circumstances such as</p>

<ol>
	<li> When user access Salesforce APIs.</li>
	<li> When user access a connected app, dashboard, or report. This process is known as step-up or high Assurance authentication.</li>
	<li> During a custom login flow or within a custom app.</li>
</ol>
<p>In multifactor authentication the user provides two evidences :</p>

<ol>
	<li> Something that the user knows like username and password.</li>
	<li> Something that is in users possession like mobile device with an authentication app or a physical security key. It can be done through Salesforce Authentication(Mobile Application), ThirdParty TOTP(Time based One-time Password) (Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, Authy etc), Security Keys which are small physical token that look like thumb drive (compatible with FIDO universal Second Factor, or FIDO2 WebAuthn Standards), or Build-in Authenticators like fingerprint or facial recofnition scanner that are build into user's device.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="h2-7">Sandbox</h2>
<p>A Salesforce sandbox is a place for the users to test and build without risk of changing or losing the valuable data on the production organization. Sandboxes help user to keep production organizations data clean during training, development and testing.</p>

<quote> Sandboxes are accessed through <samp>https://test.salesforce.com</samp>. Use username with a period and the name of the sandbox at the end like <samp>name@example.com.SanboxName</samp> and password on the day that sandbox was created.</quote>
<h3 id="h3-24">Types of Sandboxes</h3>
<p><strong>Developer</strong> Sandbox has all of the production configuration but none of the production data. They can be refreshed or pull in latest configuration from production once a day.</p>

<p>Production Configuration included in sandbox are Configurations, Apex, Metadata and All Users.</p>

<p>Has capacity of 200MB.</p>

<p>Good for development and testing.</p>

<p><strong>Developer Pro</strong> Sandbox has all the production configuration but none of the production data. They can hold more data than the Developer Sandbox and can be refreshed once per day.</p>

<p>Has capacity of 1 GB.</p>

<p>Good for development and quality assurance tasks, testing, and user training.</p>

<p><strong>Partial Copy</strong> sandbox has all the production configuration and also a sample of the real-world data from the production organization what was defined using the sandbox template. They can be refreshed once every 5 days.</p>

<p>Has capacity of 5GB.</p>

<p>Good for user acceptance testing, integration testing, and training, because it contains some of your production data.</p>

<p><strong>Full Copy</strong> sandbox is a full copy of the production organization. It includes all the configuration and most if not all data. Can be refreshed every 29 days.</p>

<p>Capacity is same as production environment.</p>

<p>An ideal testing environment since it is just like production. This is the only type of sandbox that supports performance testing, load testing, and staging. You probably donâ€™t want to use Full sandboxes for development, though, because you can only refresh configurations and data every 29 days, and that refresh can take days to complete.</p>

<p>The type and quantity of sandboxes you can set up and use depends on your license.</p>

<h3 id="h3-25">Create a New Sandbox</h3>

<p>Sandboxes once created will take several minutes or even days in the case of Full Copy to be ready to use. A notification email will be sent once the sandbox is ready to use.</p>

<quote> Once sandbox is created, check email deliverability settings (Setup | Deliverability (Quick Search) | System email only or No access). By default the System email only is the deliverability access level on any new Sandbox, but still should be checked to make sure.</quote>
<h3 id="h3-26">Refresh Sandbox</h3>
<p>To add new configuration and data from production to sandbox, they need to be refreshed by going to Sandboxes list in Setup | Sanbox and <strong>Refresh</strong> next to the sandbox's name.</p>

<p>It is important to note that a refresh will destroy any of the data or customizations created in that sandbox since last refresh.</p>
